# Contributing

## Workflow
- Open an issue first for any non-trivial change.
- Use small, reviewable PRs.
- Prefer specification-first changes: update docs/spec, then code.

## Standards
- Security-relevant changes must include a threat model and test plan.
- Performance claims must include a reproducible benchmark harness description.

## Legal / IP
Do not submit code or documents you do not have the right to license.
